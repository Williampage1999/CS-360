# CS-360

This app was made to address the need of an app that can store inventory as well as be edited adn tracked onm a screen with a sign in and registration page.

I used a sign in screen, a registration screen, a home screen as well as an edit screen. The UI designs are made simple which is overall why they were successful.

I coded my app with my Ui design in mind and overall went for functionality and easy of use within the app.

During each process I made sure to run the app and check the functionality of the app to make sure it was working as intended.

I had to innovate when coding the app becuase the UI had some issues so I had to change the UI sign in screen to make sure the app would have functional ease of use.

In the friebase implementation my code was very functional and poverall was well implmented.
